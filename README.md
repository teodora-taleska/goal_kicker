# GoalKicker: RL agent for scoring goals

### Problem statement:
The goal of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that can autonomously learn how to score goals in a football environment. The agent simulates a footballer with two robotic limbs (legs), capable of navigating to the ball, kicking it, and scoring goals. The learning process will be incremental, starting from simple tasks such as approaching the ball and advancing to complex scenarios such as avoiding a goalkeeper and precisely placing shots into the corners of the goal.

The agent learns optimal actions through interaction with a simulated environment, using rewards to guide behavior. It will be trained to:

1. Approach the ball from a close distance.
2. Kick the ball effectively.
3. Score into the goal without a goalkeeper. 
4. Avoid a dynamic goalkeeper and score regardless of their position. 
5. Learn goal shot placement, such as targeting the corners.

This project serves as a hands-on introduction to reinforcement learning, physics-based simulation, and agent-based control, with the long-term goal of developing a realistic and intelligent goal-scoring AI.
